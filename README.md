For this task, I had to scrape a webpage and translate its content to another language. Here's how I did it. 

The functions for translating and automating the script insertion can be found in the directory /translate-scripts 

- Translating Script: /translate-scripts/translate_api.js 
- Automating Script: /translate-scripts/automate_translate.py 
- Script to automate scraping images and saving them to a local directory: /translate-scripts/scrape_img.py
